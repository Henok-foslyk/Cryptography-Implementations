    "# Simple File Transfer v0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "This document specifies version 0.5 of the Simple File Transfer (SiFT) protocol. SiFT can be used by a client to send file commands to a server, which executes those commands. SiFT supports the following 7 commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __pwd__ --> Print current working directory: Returns to the client the name of the current working directory on the server.\n",
    "- __lst__ --> List content of the current working directory: Returns to the client the list of files and directories in the current working directory on the server. \n",
    "- __chd__ --> Change directory: Changes the current working directory on the server. The name of the target directory is provided as an argument to the chd command.\n",
    "- __mkd__ --> Make directory: Creates a new directory on the server. The name of the directory to be created is provided as an argument to the mkd command.\n",
    "- __del__ --> Delete file or directory: Deletes a file or a directory on the server. The name of the file or directory to be deleted is provided as an argument to the del command.\n",
    "- __upl__ --> Upload file: Uploads a file from the client to the server. The name of the file to be uploaded is provided as an argument to the upl command and the file is put in the current working directory on the server.\n",
    "- __dnl__ --> Download file: Downloads a file from the current working directory of the server to the client. The name of the file to be downloaded is provided as an argument to the dnl command.\n",
    "\n",
    "SiFT allows the client and the server to communicate via a network and execute the above commands remotely. It assumes that the client and the server uses the TCP/IP protocol to establish a connection and to send data reliably to each other. The SiFT v0.5 server must listen and accept client connection requests on TCP port 5150.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important notice:** SiFT v0.5 does not provide security for the client-server communications, so it should only be used on trusted networks."

Moreover, the upload command is followed by the execution of the Upload Protocol, which is responsible for the actual upload of the selected file to the server, and the download command is followed by the execution of the Download Protocol, which is responsible for the actual download of the selected file from the server."

    "## SiFT v0.5 Download Protocol\n",
    "The SiFT v0.5 Download Protocol is responsible for executing an actual file download operation. It must only be used by the server after sending an 'accept' response to a dnl command in the Commands Protocol, and it must only be used by the client after receiving an 'accept' response to a dnl command in the Commands Protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message exchange\n",
    "The Download Protocol  messages must be carried by the MTP protocol. The message exchange of the Download Protocol is shown in the figure below:\n",

    "    client->>server: dnload_req\n",
    "    server->>client: dnload_res_0\n",
    "    server->>client: dnload_res_0\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Download Protocol consists of 2 or more message transfers, depending on the number of file fragments to be downloaded. The server typically does not download the entire file in a single message to the client, but it divides the file into fragments and downloads the fragements in download response messages. There are two types of download responses: _dnload_res_0_ (MTP type `03 10`) and _dnload_res_1_ (MTP type `03 11`). File fragments that are followed by further file fragments are downloaded in _dnload_res_0_ messages, and the last file fragment, which is not followed by any more file fragment, is downloaded in a _dnload_res_1_ message at the end. The client learns that the download is complete by the fact of receiving a _dnload_res_1_ message. Note that if the file is small and the entire file fits in a single fragment, then the server sends only a single _dnload_res_1_ message, and this completes the entire download operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before the actual download of the file, the client must indicate if it is ready for receiving the file or prefers cancelling the file download in the _dnload_req_ message sent to the server at the beginning of the Download Protocol. The server must not start sending the file fragments until it receives this indication, and it must start sending the file fragments if the client indicates that it is ready, otherwise it must cancel the file download operation and must not send anything to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the Upload Protocol, the fragment size cannot be negotiated in this version of the Download Protocol, therefore implementations conforming this specification must use the fixed fragment size of 1024 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message formats\n",
    "\n",
    "_dnload_req_\n",
    "\n",
    "The download request message (MTP type `03 00`) has a text-based format, i.e., it contains human readable text, encoded in UTF-8 coding. The message contains a single field, which has the value 'ready' or 'cancel' (without the apostrophes), where 'ready' means that the client is ready for the download, whereas 'cancel' means that, despite the fact that the download request was accepted  by the server, the client does not want to proceed, and it cancels the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "_dnload_res_0_ and _dnload_res_1_\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of download response messages (MTP types  `03 10` and  `03 11`)  contain the raw bytes of the file fragment carried in the message. These messages have no further structuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "When the client receives a download response in the Commands Protocol, it learns from that response the size and hash of the file to be downloaded. Based on these, it may decide to proceed with the download or cancel it (e.g., it may ask the user if he/she wants to download the file given its size and its hash). The decision of the client is sent to the server in the _dnload_req_ message.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the server receives the _dnload_req_ message, it inspects its content and proceeds accordingly. If the download operation is not cancelled, the server splits the file to be downloaded into fragments of the specified size, and downloads to the client these fragments sequentially in download response messages, such that the last fragment is downloaded in a message of type _dnload_res_1_, while all preceeding fragments (if any) are downloaded in messages of type _dnload_res_0_. \n",
    "\n",
    "The client receives the download response messages and saves their content into a file. When the client receives a _dnload_res_1_ message, it knows that the download is complete. During the download operation, the client computes the size of the file received and its SHA-256 hash value. It must then verify that the file hash received matches the one previously received in the Commands Protocol as part of the server's response to the client's download request that triggered this download in the first place. If the verification fails, the client may close the connection with the server or simply notify the user that the file received has a hash value that does not match the one previously computed by the server.\n"
